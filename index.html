    Basic Idea of the Web and How it Works
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
        <p>  
        The main components of the web are <em>computers, web browsers, servers, internet, content,</em> and <em>HTTP</em>. 
        The web is the entire collection of interconnected computers and servers which communicate with each other via a protocol known as HTTP.  
        When an individual user visits a web page, the user’s web browser makes a <em>HTTP request</em>, which is sent over the internet, 
        to the server hosting the appropriate <em>HTML document</em>. The server then sends back the HTML document to the user’s computer, 
        which is then interpreted and displayed by the user’s web browser.

        Computers are able to perform tasks which are encoded via a <em>computer language</em> such as HTML. 
        While able to perform complex tasks more effectively than humans, any little error in the code 
        can have huge problems and prevent the code from performing the desired task. 
        Computers read code literally with no room for interpretation or understanding.

        This first lesson detailed some of the key points of HTML, otherwise known as <em>HyperText Markup Language.</em> 
        HTML documents comprise the majority of the content on the internet. 
        HTML documents contain <em>text content</em>, which is the content seen by users, and <em>markup</em>, 
        which controls how the text content looks. Each HTML document is comprised of <em>HTML elements</em>. 
        These elements come in different sorts and are determined via <em>tags</em>.

    Web Development Languages

    <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
        There are three languages used for web page development, <em>HTML</em>, <em>Java</em>, and <em>CSS</em>. 
        HTML gives structure and content to a page. CSS, otherwise known as <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>, gives style to the page elements, such as
        font size, text color, background, position, border, and etc. Java gives the web page an interactive element.  
        While not obvious at first, every web page on the internet is comprised of boxes.
        Boxes are defined with the "Div" tag. To add style to each box, give each element a class attribute.

    The Structure of Web Pages

    <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
        To see the structure of a web page, in Google Chrome use "Developer tools." What is shown is the structure of the 
        web page as interpreted by the web browser. Generally speaking, the structure shown is described as a tree structure.
        This is because HTML elements can have other elements nested inside them, and so on and so forth. 
        When examining a web page's code, all the code within the page can be modeled in a <em>Document Object Model</em> 
        (DOM), which is a tree-like structure of a page's code. A good summary about <em>tree structures</em> can be found 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)">here.</a>

        <p>
        Since every web page is comprised of boxes, start by <em>Boxify</em> a web page design, going from big boxes to small boxes. 
        Boxes can exist within other boxes. The same web page design can be boxifed in different ways.

    Importance of Avoiding Repetition
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
        It's a good habit to <em>avoid repetition of code</em> whenever possible. This makes your code easier to read and reduces the chances of errors.
        As an example, when using lots of repetition of styling code, it not only means a greater chance of error, but makes it more difficult to make markup changes to all desired elements. To make a simple markup change, instead of changing a small amount of code in the CSS file, you would have to change the CSS code in each one of the desired elements. This in turn leads to a greater chance of error if some of the elements are missed or incorrectly modified. Why make your coding experience harder?!?

    <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
        There are several ways to add CSS styling code to a structured HTML document:<br>
        <p>1) Write the CSS styling code in a "Style" tag nested in the “Head” tag of the HTML document. This is fine for very small projects.
        </p>
        <p>2) Link the HTML document to a separate CSS file. Both files are placed in the same project folder. Helps keep organization for larger projects. A “Head” tag is placed at the top of the HTML document with a "Link" tag inside. 
        </p>
        <p>3) Adding CSS styling in line with the HTML code. Very bad idea, leads to lots of repetition of styling code, more chances for errors in code.

      <p>
      Programming languages were invented because of shortcomings of natural languages, <em>ambiguity</em>, and <em>verbosity</em>. 
      Natural languages are often ambiguous were the same sentence or word can have different meanings. We want the computer to interpret the 
      code written to be exactly as intended by the programmer. Natural languages are also very verbose, aka wordy. 
      To write a program for a complex task in a natural language would require a lot of text. While the same task in a computer language 
      may only take a few lines of code.

      Like natural languages, programming languages have a <em>grammar</em> that allow programmers to form “valid” sentences and 
      defines what <em>strings</em> are possible in the given programming language. Python's grammar is much stricter than natural 
      language grammar. Python requires code be written with a very specific <em>syntax</em> or grammar. Code must match the 
      Python grammar exactly, otherwise "bugs" or errors would arise.

      Functions in Python are started with the word <em>def</em>. The function is then given a name followed by <em>parameters</em> in parentheses. 
      The parameters are the inputs for the function and are later replaced by actual values when the function is used. The operation of the function is signaled 
      by the keyword <em>return</em> which tells Python what to produce as an output. If a return statement is omitted from the function, the function will produce a "None"

      To make programs of greater complexity and usefulness, we need to incorporate the use of <em>arithmetic</em>, <em>if statements</em>, <em>loops</em>, <em>comparisons</em>, and <em>procedures</em>.

The indented <em>block</em> is the code the function will execute if the comparison is true. If the test expression is not true, then the block will not execute. The end of the if statement is signaled by indentation. The next statement that is not indented will run regardless whether or not the test expression is true.

If the first expression evaluates to false, the value of the or expression is taken from the value of the second expression.<br><br>

      <b>Traceback Messages</b>- When a program crashes. Usually an error message called a <em>traceback</em> is given by Python. The traceback tells you what line the code crashed on and what file it was running.<br><br>
      <b>Example Code</b>- If working example code is available use the example code as a base and step by step make the changes until you arrive to the result you wanted. Then compare your new code with your original code to see where the original code had the bug.<br><br>
      
      <b>Keep Old Version</b>- Keeping old versions of your code allows you to compare and share your code with others who can help you find the bug.<br><br>
      
      <b>Print Statements</b>- Adding print statements to your program can show where in the code the program begins to misbehave. Thus allowing you to pin point the location of the bug.

    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>        
      Lists are a type of <em>structured data</em> that let us organize information. The list is identified by square brackets, and the elements are separated by commas. The elements could be strings, numbers, characters, other lists.

    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
      Lists support <em>mutation</em>, which allows the coder to change the value of list after it has been created. Whenever the value of an element is changed, the list is being modified, nor is a new list created.

      <b>Append</b>-Adds a new element to the end of the list by mutating the old list.<br><br>
      
      <b>Plus</b>-Produces a new list by the adding the elements from two old lists. Does not mutate old lists.<br><br>
        
      <b>Len</b>-Returns the length, or number of elements in a list. Also works on strings or any object that is a collection of things.<br><br>
      
      <b>Index</b>-Returns the first position where a value is located in a list. If not found, produces an error.<br><br>    
        
      <b>In</b>-If a value is in the inquired list, returns true. Otherwise returns false.<br><br>

      For Loops go through each element of a list and executes a block of code on each element, then loops back to the next element in the list. After the last element in the list, the for loop is complete and Python goes to the next line of code.

    What do Problems Have in Common?

    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>        
      All computational problems have in common <em>inputs</em> and <em>outputs</em>. Problem are defined by possible inputs, usually an infinite set, and a relationship between the inputs ⇒ and desired outputs. A <em>solution</em> will be a procedure that can take any input from the set and produce a desired output that satisfies the relationship we want.

    Rules to Help Solve Problems 
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
      <b>What are the inputs?</b> What is the set of valid inputs? How are the inputs represented?<br><br>
        
      <b>What are the outputs?</b> How should we specify the outputs? Note if we <em>return</em> an output, we can do further computations with the output. If we <em>print</em> the output it’s hard to do anything else with the output.<br><br>
        
      <b>Work through some examples by hand.</b> Maybe start with “pseudo code” on paper. Figure out how to map the inputs to the correct outputs. Try to figure out the relationship between the two.<br><br>
        
      <b>Simple mechanical solution.</b> Consider systematically how a human can solve the problem on paper. Don’t optimize prematurely, try a simpler method first. Try to breakdown the problem.<br><br> 
        
      <b>Develop incrementally and test as you go.</b> Write small bits of code that can be tested as you go.
